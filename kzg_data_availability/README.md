This implmentation uses the BLST signature library
github.com/supranational/blst

For python, the library use SWIG definitions to create the binding.
To test the library and generate the pythong bindings, run `/bindings/python/run.me` on your BLST implementation, then copy the resultant files to [./blst/]() directory. You need to have SWIG installed from your prefered package manager.
